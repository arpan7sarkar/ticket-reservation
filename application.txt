Goal: Generate a modern, mobile-friendly interface for a local Indian train ticketing system focusing on Barasat, West Bengal. The design must prioritize speed for daily commuters and clear information for distant travelers.

1. Core Structure & Theme:
App Name: Barasat Rail-Mate

Target Device: Mobile (iOS/Android look and feel)

Color Palette: Use the colors of Indian Railways (dark blue/red/white) or a clean, modern high-contrast theme (e.g., White background, primary Bright Blue/Teal for buttons, and Orange/Yellow for urgent alerts/status).

Navigation: A simple tab bar at the bottom with three icons: Home (Booking), My Passes, and Profile.

2. Home Screen (The Booking Interface):
Purpose: Allow one-tap access to booking or pre-saved routes.

Key Components:

"Quick Booking" Card (Top): A prominent card showing the user's Saved/Favourite Route (e.g., Barasat ➡️ Sealdah) with a large "Book Now" button and the saved fare displayed below it. (This should be dismissible to show the full search.)

Station Selector (Main Focus): A large, two-field input area with clear labels:

FROM: (Placeholder: "Select Source Station... Barasat")

TO: (Placeholder: "Select Destination Station... Sealdah")

Include a Swap Icon in the middle to reverse the stations.

Train Schedule/Fare Display: Below the selection, display a dynamic section that shows the:

Current Fare: (E.g., "₹10 | Single Journey")

Next Train: (E.g., "Next Train @ 6:15 PM - Platform 2")

Primary Action Button: A large, prominent, primary-colored button at the bottom: "Find Trains & Book Ticket"

3. My Passes Screen (Commuter Focus):
Purpose: Display purchased monthly/weekly passes and previous tickets.

Key Components:

"Active Pass" Section: A clear card for the current Season Pass (if one is active).

Card Details: Route, Expiration Date, and a large "Show Digital Pass" button.

"Previous Bookings" List: A simple list view or scrollable feed of the user's last 5-10 booked tickets.

4. Profile Screen:
Purpose: User management and system settings.

Key Components:

User Info Card: Display Name, Email, and options to "Manage Saved Routes."

List of Settings: Simple list items for "Payment Methods," "Help & Support," and "Logout."

5. Technical/Integration Notes (for the developer/tool):
All data displayed (fares, routes, pass validity) must be designed to fetch from a REST API endpoint (representing the Django backend). Assume placeholder JSON data for the initial design.

The system needs placeholder UI elements for QR Code/Barcode display on the final ticket view.
